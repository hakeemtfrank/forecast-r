# Appendix

## Optional: Hacking linear regression

Linear regression is typically thought of as an approach that generates a straight line
with a slope. To make __non-linear regression__, or even __autoregression__ 
(incorporating inter-dependency between observations), additional variables need to be added to the model.

If we start with the original dataframe `my_data`, we can make a simple linear
model using `lm()` in R:

```{r}
# make linear model
linear_model <- lm(my_ts ~ time(my_ts))

# extract the model fit
linear_fit <- linear_model %>% fitted()

# visualize the fit
autoplot(my_ts) +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=time(my_ts), y=linear_fit), color="red") + 
  ggtitle("Linear Regession Fit") +
  xlab("Time") + 
  ylab("Unique Visitors")
```

This is the example from the previous section. 

To get seasonality, we incorporate information we know about the data. 
For example, summer months have more visitors to the online store. So __monthly seasonality__ is needed. 

To incorporate the seasonality, we extract the month from the date, and incorporate it as a variable.

```{r}
# transform the date 
#visitors_data <- my_data
#month_data <- my_data %>% mutate(month_name=months(Week))

```
