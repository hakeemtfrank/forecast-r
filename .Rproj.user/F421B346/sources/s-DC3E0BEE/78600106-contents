# Exponential Smoothing Methods

One of the most popular forecasting tools is __Exponential Smoothing__; it's more flexible
than linear regression, while being more simple and intuitive than ARIMA. 

Exponential smoothing methods model the data by assuming that the time series is a combination of three components: __trend, error, and seasonality__. The error in this case is the random flunctuations from one period to the next, which can be represented in the model as a component. 


$$Y_t = S_t + E_t + T_t$$


where $Y_t$ is the value of our time series at time $t$, 


However, it's not without it's downsides. First, exponential smoothing breaks down for weird seasonalities, such as a weekly seasonality, which has a _non-integer_ seasonality of 52.14. It also breaks down for series with __multiple seasonalities__. For example, if we have daily seasonality (more sales on Fridays) mixed with monthly seasonality (more sales in December), then exponential smoothing will need some modifications.
